# Otter Painter

Website that lets you click on the screen to add an otter. What more could you ever want from a website?

I made this as part of a Secret Santa thing between a few Discord friends. We all had to make something without spending any money on it, so I decided to make a website because I'm good at those.

It's a really simple SvelteKit app, deployed to Cloudflare Pages. Probably overkill, but meh. Who cares.
